Phonetic alphabet website
In radio communication it is not easy to distinguish the sound of individual letters.
To overcome this problem people use phonetic alphabets where each letter is replaced by a word.
Over radio it is much easier to distinguish the words Delta and Tango rather than the letters D and T.

There are several of these alphabets in use, and the most widely known is the pilot's alphabet beginning 
with Alpha, Bravo, Charlie (for A, B and C). For instance flight BA-461 will be spelled by pilots 
over the radio as "Bravo Alpha Four Six One". Our experimental project is a Phonetic Website that displays 
the pilot's phonetic alphabet plus two additional alphabets made up with names of cities and people.
